# Temperature-Sensor
_Author: Andres Garcia_

This Metamorphosys design project captures a simple temperature sensor circuit. A sensor on the board detects the ambient temperature, and a set of LEDs are illuminated to reflect the temperature being below, near, or above room temperature. This circuit is all analog and uses no digital components.
